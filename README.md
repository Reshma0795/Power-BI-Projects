# Sales Performance Analysis: Comparing Actual, Budgeted, and Expected Sales to Optimize Business Growth


This is a data visualization project in Microsoft PowerBI. I have imported and analyzed dataset from Excel to PowerBI and created a dashboard by developing page layouts, navigations, and designs to provide key insights and analysis about product sales across various product types, months dates.

The data I used is collected from source: https://youtu.be/X7DsnK5bD-0.
